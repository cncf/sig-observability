    description: >
      The profiling format associated with the Go computer language. It's a variant of
      [Google's C++ profiler](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools). It can trace
      CPU utilization, heap, allocations, thread creation, synchronous blocking and mutex holders.

    attributes:
      sample_type:
        - The type of data sampled along with units, e.g. "cpu", "nanoseconds"
        - Pair of indexes into the `string_table` for the name and unit of the sample type.
      sample:
        - The set of sample objects recorded.
        - Sets of objects consisting of a series of location Ids, values and labels. Refer
          to the proto definition.
      mapping:
        - The set of mappings from addresses to symbols.
        - Refer to the proto definition.
      location:
        - The set of locations referenced by samples.
        - Refer to the proto definition.
      function:
        - The set of functions referenced by locations.
        - Refer to the proto definition.
      string_table:
        - Common table for strings referenced by other objects
      drop_frames:
        - An index into the `string_table` with an optional regex matching functions to drop
          from the profile.
      keep_frames:
        - An index into the `string_table` with an optional regex matching functions to keep
            in the profile.
      time_nanos:
        - Unix epoch nanos timestamp when the profile was collected.
      duration_nanos:
        - Length of profile recording in nanoseconds.
      period_type:
        - The kind of events between sampled occurrences. E.g. [ "cpu","cycles" ] or [ "heap","bytes" ]
      period:
        - The number of events between sampled occurrences.
      comment:
        - Optional comment about the profile. Index to the string table.
      default_sample_type:
        - Index into the string table of the prefered sample value.
