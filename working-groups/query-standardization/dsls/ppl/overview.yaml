description: >
  PPL (Pipe Processing Language) is a query language used in OpenSearch, allowing users to interact with their data in a more expressive and readable manner.
  It features a structure similar to Unix's pipe commands, where operations are chained together using a pipe symbol (|).
  This design enables users to perform complex queries in a more intuitive way, such as filtering, transforming, and aggregating data.
  By leveraging PPL, developers can enhance their ability to extract insights from large datasets within the OpenSearch ecosystem.
