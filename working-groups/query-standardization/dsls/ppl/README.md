# Piped Processing Language DSL Survey Response

### **Short Description:**

PPL (Pipe Processing Language) is a query language used in OpenSearch, allowing users to interact with their data in a more expressive and readable manner. It features a structure similar to Unix's pipe commands, where operations are chained together using a pipe symbol (|). This design enables users to perform complex queries in a more intuitive way, such as filtering, transforming, and aggregating data. By leveraging PPL, developers can enhance their ability to extract insights from large datasets within the OpenSearch ecosystem.

The PPL (Pipe Processing Language) architecture within OpenSearch is built to facilitate querying and data manipulation in a way that resembles Unix's pipe commands.

### Overview

1. **Design Goals**:

    * **URI Friendliness**: 
      * Enables intuitive querying through RESTful API - Using [POST API](https://github.com/opensearch-project/sql/blob/main/docs/user/ppl/interfaces/endpoint.rst#post)
    * **Minimal Syntax**:
      * Human-readable and concise.
    * **Advanced Analytical Capabilities**:
      * Supports aggregation, filtering, etc. (See additional details in the following sections below)
    * **Easily extensible :** 
      * support simple and build in extension mechanics

   1. **Deficiencies in Other DSLs**:

       * Emphasize the pipe based data transformation patterns common to realtime analytics and batch processing
       * A need for a simpler, more consistent querying language led to the design of PPL.

       **Simplicity and Readability**: PPL introduces a more human-readable syntax, similar to the SQL language, allowing users to write queries in a more intuitive and straightforward manner.
       This enhances the usability for both newcomers and seasoned professionals.

       **Flexibility**: It offers various operators and functions that enable complex data processing tasks, like filtering, transforming, and aggregating data.
       This allows for more sophisticated analyses without the need for additional tools.

       **Performance Optimization**: PPL's query execution is optimized, enabling faster processing of large-scale data. It can leverage OpenSearch's distributed architecture to parallelize operations, thus speeding up query responses.

Integration with OpenSearch: Being tightly integrated with OpenSearch, PPL allows for seamless interaction with other features and plugins in the OpenSearch ecosystem.

Consistency across Observability Tools: By standardizing the query language, PPL ensures a consistent experience across various observability tools within the OpenSearch suite, minimizing the learning curve when transitioning between different tools.

Enhanced Debugging and Error Handling: PPL provides more informative error messages and debugging features, making it easier to identify and fix issues in queries.

1. **Languages that Inspired the DSL**:

    * SQL, and other structured query languages.
    * Splunk Query Language

1. **Observability Use Cases Designed For**:

    * Analyzing logs, metrics, and tracing data.

1. **Observability Use Cases Omitted**:

    * Joins are currently not supported in a full extent - Work In Progress

1. **Strengths and Weaknesses**:

    * **Strengths**: Flexibility, ease of learning.
    * **Weaknesses**: May lack some specific functionalities of other DSLs.

1. **Intended for At-Rest and/or Streaming Data**:

    1. _**At-Rest Data**:_
       At-rest data refers to data that is stored persistently on disk, and it's not in active use or transit.

       **Querying**: PPL enables querying this at-rest data, allowing users to perform analyses on historical data, generate reports, and derive insights.
       
       **Performance**: PPL's syntax and optimizations are designed to handle large-scale at-rest data efficiently.
       
       **Integration with OpenSearch**: Since PPL is integrated with OpenSearch, it can interact seamlessly with data indexed and stored within OpenSearch clusters.
   2. _**Streaming Data:**_
      Streaming data refers to data that is continuously generated, often by various sources like sensors, applications, or online services.

       **Real-Time Analysis**: PPL can be used to analyze streaming data as it arrives. This is essential for real-time monitoring, alerting, and decision-making.
       
       **Combination with At-Rest Data**: PPL's ability to handle both streaming and at-rest data enables complex analyses that combine real-time data with historical data. This integration can lead to more comprehensive insights.
       
       **Adaptability**: Since streaming data often comes in unbounded and fast-paced, PPL's flexibility in query formulation helps in adapting to the dynamic nature of this data.

1. **Source Specification**:

    * Users can specify indices or aliases or generic data-sources that abstract the tables as a logical raw data .

1. **Joining with Other Sources**:

    * Joining multiple indices is supported; joining with external sources like CSV is not yet supported.
